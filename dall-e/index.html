    <div id="description">
        <p>This page is my collection of images generated by the AI text-to-image tool <a
                href="https://www.craiyon.com/">Craiyon</a> (formerly DALL-E mini). I created this page to share images
            that I found visually stunning, impressive, or creative, but I also include the less attractive ones that
            reveal my thoughts and passions. It is important to note that I did not create these images. If you want to
            use these images, please respect Craiyon <a href="https://www.craiyon.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

        <p>I enter text into Craiyon to seek artistic inspirations, express my emotion (ðŸ‘€), satisfy my curiosity, and
            explore the limit of what a computer program can do. While being impressed by the power of a mathematical
            model, I sometimes thought, if an AI can overperform an average human in creative tasks, is it still worthy
            for humans to be creative? My current standing on this is while this model can be a source of inspiration
            for creators, one needs to recognize that it is humans that created and provided feedback to this model,
            plus humans need inspiration for the model's text inputs. Even though AIs sometimes produce nicer images
            than humans, it should be humans who enjoy the explorative and challenging creative process. This is one of
            my primary motivations to write code despite the existence of powerful commercial software. Instead of
            relying on AI, humans should combine the convenience of technology with human creativity and passion to
            produce more outstanding designs.</p>
