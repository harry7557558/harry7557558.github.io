## Finding $f_p$

After seeing the equations with power $p=0,1,2,3$, one may have a question: are their equations for higher $p$? What do these equations look like?

I thought about this problem two years ago. My approach to generate arbitrary $f_p$ was as follows:

- Assume the degree of $f_p$ is $d=p+1$
- Sample $f_p(0),f_p(1),\cdots f_p(d)$
- Find the coefficients of a $d$-th degree polynomial that goes through $(0,f_p(0)),(1,f_p(1)),\cdots(d,f_p(d))$

When I get a list of points $(x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),\cdots(x_d,y_d)$, to find a polynomial that goes through all of the points, I let the polynomial be $\displaystyle{P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{d}c_{i}x^{i}}$. One can see:

$\displaystyle{y_j=\sum_{i=0}^{d}c_{i}x_j^i}=\begin{bmatrix}x_j^0&x_j^1&\cdots&x_j^d\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}c_0\\c_1\\\vdots\\c_d\end{bmatrix}$&emsp;&emsp;  for $0\le j\le d$

Put all points together, I get the following systems of linear equations:

$\begin{bmatrix}y_0\\[3pt]y_1\\[3pt]\vdots\\[3pt]y_d\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}x_0^0&x_0^1&\cdots&x_0^d\\[3pt]x_1^0&x_1^1&\cdots&x_1^d\\[3pt]\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\[3pt]x_d^0&x_d^1&\cdots&x_d^d\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}c_0\\[3pt]c_1\\[3pt]\vdots\\[3pt]c_d\end{bmatrix}$

Note that the matrix is a Vandermonde matrix. Its determinant is non-zero since all $x$ values are distinct, so the linear system always have an unique solution. I wrote a Python script that solves the linear system using elimination and determines the coefficients of the polynomial, and thus finds $f_p$.

```py
def find_fp(p):
    from math import gcd
    d = p+1

    # sample points
    x = [xj for xj in range(0,d+1)]
    y = [sum([k**p for k in range(1,xj+1)]) for xj in x]

    # matrix and vector
    A = [[xj**i for i in range(0,d+1)] for xj in x]
    c = [yj for yj in y]

    # solve the linear system using elimination
    for i in range(0,d+1):
        for j in range(0,d+1):
            if j!=i:
                Aii,Aji = A[i][i],A[j][i]
                Aii,Aji = Aii//gcd(Aii,Aji),Aji//gcd(Aii,Aji)  # prevent large numbers
                for k in range(0,d+1):
                    A[j][k] = A[j][k]*Aii-A[i][k]*Aji
                c[j] = c[j]*Aii-c[i]*Aji

    # return the coefficients of the polynomial
    # as a list of fraction strings in increasing power
    c = [[c[i]//gcd(A[i][i],c[i]), A[i][i]//gcd(A[i][i],c[i])] for i in range(d+1)]
    return [str(f[0])+'/'+str(f[1]) for f in c]
```

*&#42;Additional note: another approach to find a polynomial that goes through a list of points is [Lagrange interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial).*
